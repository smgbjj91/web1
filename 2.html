<p>Having its roots in the Japanese martial art and sport of judo, Gracie/Brazilian jiu-jitsu adopted a similar colored belt system to signify a practitioner's progression within the art. However, to differentiate jiu-jitsu from the other disciplines, a solid bar was included on the belt near one of the ends.</p>
